# Ontology Action Layer v1 Design

Date: 2026-06-13

## Purpose

This document defines a controlled ontology action layer for the ontology-native
semantic operations platform. It is inspired by Palantir-style ontology actions,
where users operate on real-world objects through governed transactions rather
than editing raw graph triples or backend tables.

The v1 action layer is a design contract. It does not expose public write
endpoints, add authentication, mutate production data, or allow browser-supplied
SPARQL/SPARQL Update. Runtime implementation must remain behind internal
semantic-service boundaries, managed graph URI policy, SHACL/provenance gates,
rollback behavior, and future authorization decisions.

## Success Contract

The action layer is acceptable only if every action:

- maps to a real ontology object or object set
- has an explicit user intent, parameter contract, preconditions, and disabled
  reason
- records a durable action audit event before any promoted graph state changes
- validates candidate facts with SHACL where graph state could change
- attaches provenance linking the action, actor, source facts, candidate facts,
  validation report, and promotion or rejection outcome
- preserves last-known-good canonical/reasoning/operations graphs on validation
  or write failure
- never exposes raw SPARQL, arbitrary graph URIs, or unrestricted graph writes

## Existing Boundaries

Current implementation state:

- The React UI is read-only over approved semantic query IDs.
- The private semantic endpoint is loopback-only and handles
  `POST /semantic/query/{queryId}` for approved read-only query IDs.
- Source promotion and reasoning refresh already run through internal
  semantic-service paths with SHACL/provenance gates and rollback snapshots.
- Phase 8 and Phase 9 reserve service boundaries for provenance lookup,
  promotion review, and AI governance handoff, but they do not define a general
  operator action layer.
- `ontology/modules/operations.ttl`, `ontology/modules/provenance.ttl`, and
  `ontology/modules/ai-interaction.ttl` provide the closest existing vocabulary
  anchors: operational findings, source/promotion/reasoning activities, and
  approval/guardrail concepts.

## Action Layer Object Model

The v1 action model introduces these conceptual resources. They may be added to
the ontology in a later implementation phase, but this design keeps them
contract-level until runtime authority is approved.

| Concept | Purpose | Candidate ontology placement |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `OntologyActionType` | Stable action definition such as `AcknowledgeRestoreBlocker`. | `operations.ttl` |
| `OntologyActionRequest` | User-initiated request to execute an action. | `operations.ttl` |
| `OntologyActionExecution` | Audit record for validation, execution, and outcome. | `provenance.ttl` or `operations.ttl` |
| `OntologyActionDecision` | Approval, rejection, or review decision for governed actions. | `operations.ttl`, with AI-specific decisions still in `ai-interaction.ttl` |
| `ActionValidationReport` | SHACL/policy/precondition result for the action request. | `evidence.ttl` or `operations.ttl` |
| `ActionAuditGraph` | Managed graph for action requests, decisions, validation reports, and audit lineage. | `urn:dcai:graph:action-audit:*` |

The action layer must distinguish three graph states:

| State | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| Requested | The user asked for an action, but no graph state has changed. |
| Candidate | The action produced candidate facts in an audit graph or reasoning-audit graph. |
| Promoted | The candidate facts passed validation, provenance, and policy gates and were written to an approved graph. |

## Managed Graph Policy

V1 actions may use only managed graph URI families:

| Graph family | Purpose | Write authority |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `urn:dcai:graph:action-audit:*` | Action requests, decisions, validation reports, disabled reasons, and immutable audit events. | Internal semantic-service action runner only |
| `urn:dcai:graph:reasoning-audit:*` | Candidate reasoning findings awaiting approval/rejection. | Existing reasoning refresh path plus action runner |
| `urn:dcai:graph:reasoning:*` | Approved reasoning findings. | Existing reasoning promotion service only |
| `urn:dcai:graph:operations:*` | Future approved operator workflow state. | Not implemented in v1 |
| `urn:dcai:graph:provenance:*` | Source, promotion, reasoning, and action lineage. | Internal semantic-service graph services only |

V1 must not let the UI submit graph names. The runtime chooses graph URIs from
release/batch/action metadata.

## Action Contracts

### 1. `AcknowledgeRestoreBlocker`

Purpose: record that an operator reviewed a restore-readiness blocker and
understands why restore is still blocked.

| Field | Contract |
| --- | --- |
| Primary objects | `RestoreReadinessFinding`, `RecoveryBlocker`, `InfrastructureIncident` |
| UI placement | Selected finding Summary action area; Trust tab when blocker is trust-related |
| Parameters | `findingUri`, `incidentUri`, `actorId`, `acknowledgedAt`, `acknowledgementReason`, optional `nextReviewAt` |
| Preconditions | Finding exists; finding status is `NOT_READY` or `REVIEW`; incident is not terminal/restored; source and reasoning provenance exist; actor is allowed by future policy |
| Candidate facts | `OntologyActionExecution` with action type, actor, timestamp, target finding, acknowledgement reason, and `prov:used` links to blocker, readiness, and evidence facts |
| SHACL/provenance gates | Action request has target object, actor, timestamp, reason, and `prov:used` links; target finding has `prov:wasGeneratedBy` reasoning activity |
| Promotion behavior | V1 records audit only. Future operations graph may mark blocker as acknowledged for UI state. |
| Rollback behavior | If audit graph write fails, no approved graph changes occur. If future operations write fails, restore previous operations graph snapshot. |
| Disabled reasons | Missing provenance; finding already terminal; incident restored; actor lacks future permission; missing acknowledgement reason |

### 2. `AssignEvidenceReview`

Purpose: assign a trust/evidence problem to an operator or team without editing
the canonical evidence fact itself.

| Field | Contract |
| --- | --- |
| Primary objects | `TrustFinding`, `EvidenceRecord`, `InfrastructureIncident`, `SourceRecord` |
| UI placement | Trust tab action area; Summary canvas when trust state is not `TRUSTED` |
| Parameters | `trustFindingUri`, `incidentUri`, `assignedTeam`, optional `assigneeId`, `dueAt`, `priority`, `assignmentReason` |
| Preconditions | Trust finding exists; trust state is `WARNING`, `UNVERIFIED`, or equivalent; referenced evidence/source record is available; assignment target is from controlled team vocabulary |
| Candidate facts | Evidence review assignment action execution linked to trust finding, source record, and evidence record |
| SHACL/provenance gates | Assignment has exactly one trust finding target, controlled assignment team, timestamp, actor, and provenance links |
| Promotion behavior | V1 records audit only. Future operations graph may expose active review assignment state. |
| Rollback behavior | Failed audit write leaves findings and provenance unchanged. Future operations write restores snapshot on failure. |
| Disabled reasons | No trust finding; trusted evidence; missing source record; uncontrolled assignment target; missing due date when policy requires one |

### 3. `RecordValidationReview`

Purpose: record operator review of validation evidence without allowing direct
browser edits to canonical validation evidence.

| Field | Contract |
| --- | --- |
| Primary objects | `ValidationEvidence`, `WorkflowEvent`, `WorkOrderEvidence`, `InfrastructureIncident`, `RestoreReadinessFinding` |
| UI placement | Trust tab validation evidence section; Summary action area when current stage is Validation |
| Parameters | `incidentUri`, `validationEvidenceUri`, `reviewedStatus`, `reviewerId`, `reviewedAt`, `reviewSummary`, optional `supportingEvidenceUri` |
| Preconditions | Incident is in or blocked by validation; validation evidence exists or the action is explicitly a missing-evidence review; reviewed status uses controlled vocabulary; conflicting evidence is surfaced before submission |
| Candidate facts | Action execution and validation review note in action audit graph; future source-system connector may turn approved review into source evidence |
| SHACL/provenance gates | Controlled `reviewedStatus`; reviewer and timestamp required; action must cite validation evidence or missing-evidence finding |
| Promotion behavior | V1 audit only. It must not overwrite canonical validation evidence. Future implementation should write back through a source-system connector or operations graph. |
| Rollback behavior | Audit write failure leaves all graphs unchanged. Future writeback failures must not change canonical graph and must record rejection in action audit. |
| Disabled reasons | No validation context; uncontrolled status; unresolved conflicting evidence; missing reviewer; restored incident |

### 4. `ApproveReasoningFinding`

Purpose: approve a candidate reasoning finding for promotion from audit state to
the approved reasoning graph.

| Field | Contract |
| --- | --- |
| Primary objects | `DependencyImpactFinding`, `RecoveryBlocker`, `RestoreReadinessFinding`, `TrustFinding`, `BlastRadiusFinding`, `ReasoningActivity` |
| UI placement | Admin/lifecycle review view; selected finding advanced section only when displaying candidate/audit state |
| Parameters | `candidateFindingUri`, `reasoningActivityUri`, `actorId`, `decisionAt`, `approvalReason`, optional `approvedUntilGraphRelease` |
| Preconditions | Candidate exists in reasoning-audit graph; reasoning-output SHACL validation conforms; candidate has `prov:wasDerivedFrom` and `prov:wasGeneratedBy`; canonical graph release is current; no conflicting higher-priority rejection exists |
| Candidate facts | Approval decision in action audit graph linked to candidate finding, validation report, canonical release, and reasoning activity |
| SHACL/provenance gates | Candidate output shapes conform; approval decision has actor, time, reason, target, and validation report |
| Promotion behavior | Existing reasoning promotion service promotes approved candidate output to `urn:dcai:graph:reasoning:*` with rollback snapshots. |
| Rollback behavior | If promotion write fails, restore previous reasoning graph snapshot and keep approval decision plus failure evidence in action audit. |
| Disabled reasons | SHACL failure; missing provenance; stale canonical release; already approved/rejected; unresolved conflict |

### 5. `RejectReasoningFinding`

Purpose: reject a candidate reasoning finding while preserving the reason and
evidence for auditability.

| Field | Contract |
| --- | --- |
| Primary objects | Same reasoning finding classes as `ApproveReasoningFinding` |
| UI placement | Admin/lifecycle review view; selected finding advanced section for candidate/audit state |
| Parameters | `candidateFindingUri`, `reasoningActivityUri`, `actorId`, `decisionAt`, `rejectionReason`, optional `replacementRequested` |
| Preconditions | Candidate exists in reasoning-audit graph; actor can review; rejection reason is present; candidate has provenance or rejection explicitly cites missing provenance |
| Candidate facts | Rejection decision in action audit graph linked to candidate finding and validation/provenance evidence |
| SHACL/provenance gates | Decision shape requires target, actor, timestamp, reason, and outcome `REJECTED` |
| Promotion behavior | No approved reasoning graph write. Candidate remains in audit graph as rejected or is superseded by a later reasoning run. |
| Rollback behavior | Failed audit write leaves approved graph unchanged and does not delete candidate findings. |
| Disabled reasons | Missing rejection reason; candidate already promoted; actor lacks future permission |

### 6. `RequestReasoningRefresh`

Purpose: request an internal reasoning refresh over a controlled canonical graph
release or limited incident/asset scope.

| Field | Contract |
| --- | --- |
| Primary objects | Canonical graph release, `InfrastructureIncident`, `InfrastructureAsset`, reasoning rule set |
| UI placement | Admin/lifecycle status view; optional detail advanced action when a selected finding appears stale |
| Parameters | `scopeType`, `scopeUri`, `requestedBy`, `requestReason`, optional `ruleSetId`, optional `canonicalGraphRelease` |
| Preconditions | Canonical graph exists and conforms; no refresh is already running for same scope; rule set is approved; scope is controlled and not browser-supplied graph URI |
| Candidate facts | Reasoning refresh request in action audit graph; reasoning run produces candidate output in reasoning-audit graph |
| SHACL/provenance gates | Refresh request has controlled scope, actor, timestamp, rule set, and canonical release; reasoning output validates before promotion |
| Promotion behavior | Internal reasoning service may execute refresh; approval/promotion remains separate unless policy allows auto-approval for low-risk findings |
| Rollback behavior | If refresh fails, previous approved reasoning graph remains last-known-good. Record failure in action audit. |
| Disabled reasons | Missing conforming canonical graph; stale or unknown release; unsupported scope; existing refresh in progress; unapproved rule set |

### 7. `ApprovePromotionBatch`

Purpose: approve promotion of a validated source/canonical/provenance or
reasoning batch after graph lifecycle review.

| Field | Contract |
| --- | --- |
| Primary objects | `PromotionActivity`, source extract batch, canonical graph candidate, provenance graph candidate, reasoning release manifest |
| UI placement | Admin/lifecycle review view only, not operator inbox |
| Parameters | `promotionBatchId`, `candidateGraphUris`, `releaseManifestId`, `actorId`, `decisionAt`, `approvalReason` |
| Preconditions | Candidate graphs use managed URIs; source/canonical/reasoning SHACL gates pass; provenance coverage is complete; release manifest exists; rollback snapshot is available |
| Candidate facts | Promotion approval decision in action audit graph linked to promotion activity, validation report, release manifest, and candidate graphs |
| SHACL/provenance gates | Candidate graph validation reports conform; approval decision has actor/time/reason; every promoted fact has source or reasoning provenance |
| Promotion behavior | Existing promotion services perform controlled graph writes and update release metadata. |
| Rollback behavior | Any write failure restores previous canonical/provenance/reasoning/operations graphs from snapshots. Approval decision remains audited with failure outcome. |
| Disabled reasons | Validation failed; missing provenance; unmanaged graph URI; missing rollback snapshot; release manifest mismatch; actor lacks future permission |

## UI Placement Strategy

V1 UI should show action affordances without claiming writeback is available.

| UI area | Action treatment |
| --- | --- |
| Dashboard operational focus strip | Filter-only actions such as restore blocked, trust review, redundancy lost, capacity at risk, validation stage. These are not ontology write actions. |
| Findings table | Keep as object-set view. Rows should show recommended next action and disabled/action-needed state, not execute writes directly. |
| Selected finding Summary | Show primary operator action placeholders: acknowledge blocker, assign evidence review, request validation review. UI remains disabled until a governed request path exists. |
| Trust tab | Place evidence review assignment and validation review actions beside the evidence they affect. |
| Dependencies tab | Read-only in v1. Do not allow relationship edits from the operator view. |
| Admin/lifecycle view | Place reasoning finding approval/rejection, reasoning refresh request, and promotion batch approval here. This view does not exist yet and should be a separate future goal. |

Action buttons must display one of three states:

- Available: only after runtime, policy, and validation support exists.
- Disabled with reason: action is conceptually valid but cannot execute.
- Hidden: action does not apply to the selected object type or state.

## Runtime Boundary Strategy

The first executable step is an internal action runner, not a public API.

Preferred v1 runtime sequence:

```text
UI displays action contract and disabled reason
-> internal action request DTO
-> precondition validator
-> action audit candidate model
-> SHACL/provenance validation
-> managed action-audit graph write
-> optional existing promotion/reasoning service call
-> rollback on failed graph write
-> action status read model
```

Future HTTP or UI execution must wait for:

- authentication and authorization policy
- actor identity model
- action permission checks
- timeout/result-size policy for action readbacks
- idempotency keys
- conflict detection
- replay and rollback tests
- source-system writeback policy

## Internal Action Audit Runner v1

The internal action audit runner implements audit-only execution for:

- `AcknowledgeRestoreBlocker`
- `AssignEvidenceReview`
- `RecordValidationReview`

It accepts controlled local `.properties` action request fixtures, validates
parameters and graph preconditions against managed canonical, provenance, and
reasoning graphs, maps valid requests into RDF action-audit/provenance records,
validates the audit graph with SHACL, and writes only to
`urn:dcai:graph:action-audit:*` through `NamedGraphStore`.

The runner does not mutate canonical, reasoning, or operations graphs. It does
not expose HTTP write endpoints, add authentication, perform source-system
writeback, implement AI governance, or enable browser execution. The React
affordances remain read-only/disabled until a future governed request surface is
approved.

## Action Status Read Model

Before enabling execution, add read-only query IDs for action state:

| Query | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `semanticAvailableActionsByFinding` | Return action labels, enabled/disabled state, disabled reason, and required parameters for a selected finding. |
| `semanticActionHistoryByTarget` | Return action audit events for an incident, finding, evidence record, or promotion batch. |
| `semanticPendingReasoningApprovals` | Return candidate reasoning findings awaiting approve/reject decisions. |
| `semanticPromotionBatchReviewList` | Return graph lifecycle batches awaiting approval. |

These are read models. They do not execute actions.

## Verification Requirements For Implementation

Any future implementation goal must verify:

- no public endpoint exposure unless explicitly approved
- no raw SPARQL or SPARQL Update from browser/client input
- action DTO validation rejects unknown action types, unmanaged graph URIs, and
  missing required parameters
- SHACL validation fails closed
- provenance is required before any promoted state change
- failed graph writes restore last-known-good graphs
- deterministic reruns do not duplicate action executions when an idempotency
  key is reused
- UI shows disabled reasons and does not imply action execution when runtime is
  disabled
- source scans confirm no auth/public endpoint/AI governance scope drift unless
  explicitly approved

## Explicit Non-goals

This v1 design and current implementation do not:

- implement public or browser-executable action execution
- expose public or private write endpoints
- add authentication or authorization
- mutate real production data
- edit frontend read models beyond future placement guidance
- implement AI governance workflows
- implement source-system writeback
- replace source promotion or reasoning promotion services

## Recommended Next Goal

```text
/goal Implement read-only ontology action affordance v1: add semantic action contract metadata and UI-disabled action states for selected findings, showing available action labels, required parameters, and disabled reasons without executing writes. Keep all graph writes internal-only and unimplemented, do not expose public endpoints/auth, do not mutate production data, commit, or push.
```

## Implementation Note

Read-only action affordance v1 is implemented in the selected finding Summary
and Trust views. Internal action audit runner v1 adds CLI-only audit writes for
three controlled action contracts. The UI remains read-only and disabled; the
runner remains internal-only and does not expose write endpoints, add
authentication, mutate canonical/reasoning/operations graphs, implement AI
governance, or allow browser-supplied SPARQL/SPARQL Update.
