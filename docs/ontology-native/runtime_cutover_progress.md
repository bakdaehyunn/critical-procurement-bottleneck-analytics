# Ontology-Native Runtime Cutover Progress

## Current Status

The ontology-native semantic-service now owns the first private read-model
contracts for several active product surfaces. The React workbench data adapter
now calls the private semantic-service endpoint instead of the old FastAPI
`/api/*` routes.

This is now an active runtime cutover state. The frontend adapter maps semantic
envelopes into the existing UI contracts, while the tracked
FastAPI/Postgres/SQLAlchemy backend has been removed from the active tree. The
remaining work is ongoing semantic enrichment, not preserving or reactivating
the old relational runtime.

## Semantic-Service Read Models Implemented

Approved private query IDs:

- `semanticFollowUpQueueList`
- `semanticDashboardOverview`
- `semanticFilterMetadata`
- `semanticFollowUpDetail`
- `semanticImpactSummary`
- `semanticTopologyDependencies`
- `semanticTrustFindingList`
- `semanticStageBottlenecks`
- `semanticAssetDelaySummary`
- `semanticZoneDelaySummary`
- `semanticSpareWaitSummary`
- `semanticValidationSummary`
- `semanticIncidentEvidence`
- `semanticIncidentTimeline`
- `semanticDependencyImpactByAsset`
- `semanticBlastRadiusByAsset`

These read models are backed by parseable read-only SPARQL, query manifest
entries, typed Kotlin envelopes, `QueryResultShaper` support,
`SemanticResponseSerializer` support, private endpoint allowlist entries, and
focused tests.

## Former Active Frontend Routes Now Routed Through Semantic-Service

`frontend/src/api.ts` no longer calls these old FastAPI routes directly:

- `GET /api/overview`
- `GET /api/follow-ups`
- `GET /api/downtime/stages`
- `GET /api/assets/delays`
- `GET /api/zones/delays`
- `GET /api/spares/waiting`
- `GET /api/data-quality/checks`
- `GET /api/impact/summary`
- `GET /api/topology/dependencies`
- `GET /api/metadata/filters`
- `GET /api/follow-ups/{incident_id}`
- `GET /api/semantic/validation`
- `GET /api/semantic/query/incident-evidence/{incident_id}`
- `GET /api/semantic/query/dependency-impact/{asset_id}`
- `GET /api/semantic/query/blast-radius/{asset_id}`

The new semantic-service read models cover first semantic slices for overview,
queue, filters, detail, impact, topology, trust, stage bottlenecks, asset delay
summaries, zone delay summaries, spare/vendor wait summaries, validation
summaries, incident evidence lookup, incident timeline lookup, dependency
impact lookup, and blast-radius lookup.

## Compatibility Adapter Gaps

The active frontend cutover now reads graph-backed values for priority rank,
request title, current status, hours in current stage, needed-by time, priority
level, business impact, priority score inputs, capacity risk, GPU impact,
redundancy, mitigation, vendor state, thermal exposure, stage thresholds,
stage history, aggregate downtime/wait-hour summaries, evidence timestamps,
work-order assignment, validation-result rows, telemetry readings, telemetry
alerts, repeat-failure counters, engineer-assignment counters, and semantic
trust-finding detail records when those fields exist in the semantic graph.

Incident, evidence, dependency-impact, blast-radius, and trust-finding lookups
now use approved parameterized semantic queries instead of fetching broad graph
result sets and filtering them in the browser.

The adapter still keeps narrow defensive fallbacks for optional graph facts
that may be absent from a fixture or future source extract. Those fallbacks are
not old-runtime dependencies.

## Deletion Status

The old tracked runtime package has been deleted from the active worktree. The
remaining gate is to avoid deleting semantic contracts or frontend adapter
guards until replacement graph facts and tests exist.

Current checks should prove:

1. Every active frontend route has a semantic-service query or command
   operation.
2. React no longer calls old `/api/*` routes.
3. Old backend tests are migrated to semantic-service/frontend checks or
   retired with documented reason.
4. `rg` scans prove remaining FastAPI/Postgres/SQLAlchemy references are
   historical/reference documentation, not active runtime requirements.

## Latest Product Polish Slice

The post-cutover polish slice added graph-backed support for telemetry alerts,
repeat-failure counters, engineer-assignment counters, semantic data-quality
detail lookup, and parameterized incident/asset query execution. These
contracts are covered by RDF fixture facts, read-only SPARQL bindings, Kotlin
envelopes, result shaping, serializer output, frontend adapter mapping, and
focused tests.
