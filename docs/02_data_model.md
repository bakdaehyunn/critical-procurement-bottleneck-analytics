# Data Model

This document preserves the historical relational vocabulary used to explain
source records, joins, and scoring fields. The active runtime is the
ontology-native semantic operations platform described in the architecture and
semantic-service docs.

## Raw Tables

- `raw_infrastructure_incidents`
- `raw_incident_stage_events`
- `raw_facility_work_orders`
- `raw_validation_results`
- `raw_telemetry_alerts`

Raw tables keep source-shaped payloads for traceability and duplicate detection.

## Core Tables

- `infrastructure_zones`: AI data center halls, power paths, cooling loops, backup power areas, and monitoring zones
- `infrastructure_assets`: CRAH, UPS, PDU, chiller, CDU, generator, rack sensor, and switchgear assets
- `infrastructure_dependencies`: directed topology edges where one asset depends on another asset for power, cooling, control telemetry, or redundancy support
- `facilities_engineers`: facilities teams and skill groups
- `critical_spares`: cooling, power, generator, sensor, and metering spares
- `infrastructure_incidents`: normalized downtime follow-up incidents
- `incident_stage_events`: event history used for state reconstruction
- `facility_work_orders`: assigned facilities work and spare/vendor state
- `validation_results`: return-to-service validation evidence
- `telemetry_alerts`: linked monitoring evidence
- `infrastructure_impact_snapshots`: latest-known rack, GPU, capacity, redundancy, thermal, vendor ETA, mitigation, and telemetry reading context for an incident

## Historical Analytics Tables

- `incident_current_status`: reconstructed current state and delay signal
- `incident_stage_lead_times`: stage duration, threshold, and bottleneck signal
- `downtime_follow_up_queue`: ranked actionable incidents, recommended actions, and score components for delay, spare/vendor risk, capacity risk, redundancy risk, thermal risk, vendor ETA risk, and mitigation credit
- `infrastructure_bottleneck_summary`: grouped stage delay by operational dimensions
- `asset_delay_summary`: downtime concentration by infrastructure asset
- `zone_delay_summary`: downtime concentration by data center zone
- `spare_waiting_summary`: spare/vendor wait impact

## Ops Tables

- `pipeline_runs`
- `data_quality_check_results`
- `infrastructure_reconciliation_issues`

## Relationship Summary

- An incident belongs to one infrastructure asset and one infrastructure zone.
- An infrastructure dependency links a dependent asset to an upstream dependency asset. Example paths include rack -> PDU -> UPS -> switchgear -> generator and rack -> CRAH/CDU/chiller.
- Stage events belong to an incident and reconstruct its timeline.
- Work orders belong to an incident and may reference a facilities engineer and critical spare.
- Validation results belong to an incident and indicate restore readiness.
- Telemetry alerts belong to an asset and may link to an incident.
- Impact snapshots belong to an incident, asset, and zone. The semantic scoring layer uses the latest snapshot per incident when scoring active follow-up work.
- Reconciliation issues are tied to a pipeline run and may link to an incident and asset.
