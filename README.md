# AI Data Center Infrastructure Semantic Operations Platform

AI Data Center Infrastructure Semantic Operations Platform is a semantic ontology platform for AI data center facilities follow-up decisions.

It answers one practical question:

> Which AI infrastructure incidents are delaying return-to-service, where is the blocker, and what should the team follow up next?

## Why This Exists

AI data center downtime evidence rarely lives in one clean system. Incident records, workflow events, facility work orders, critical spares, vendor waits, validation results, telemetry alerts, impact snapshots, infrastructure assets, and facility zones are often scattered across different operational tools.

That creates a real follow-up problem: teams may know that work is open, but they cannot quickly tell whether GPU capacity risk is blocked by triage, engineer assignment, a spare/vendor wait, repair execution, validation, missed vendor ETA, lost redundancy, or unreliable source data.

This project builds a semantic operations layer for that problem. It preserves raw source records, normalizes them into a data center infrastructure model, reconstructs state from event history, validates the RDF graph with SHACL, exposes SPARQL-backed semantic evidence, and produces a ranked follow-up queue.

## Customer Problem

The fictional customer is an AI infrastructure operations team responsible for GPU data halls. During downtime, facilities supervisors, reliability engineers, capacity operations, and data engineers each see part of the truth:

- incident tickets show priority and current status
- work orders show team ownership and repair state
- spare and vendor notes show external dependencies
- telemetry shows power, cooling, thermal, and sensor evidence
- validation records show whether return-to-service is safe
- impact snapshots show affected racks, GPUs, kW at risk, redundancy, and mitigation

Before this system, the blocked operational decision was:

> Which open infrastructure incident should the operator chase next so GPU capacity can safely return to service?

The follow-up queue is the core product answer. Summaries, selected-row context, and detail pages support the decision, but they are not the main product surface.

## Operating Scenario

The modeled AI data center infrastructure workflow is:

```text
Incident Reported
-> Facilities Triage
-> Engineer Assigned
-> Spare/Vendor Waiting
-> Repair In Progress
-> Validation
-> Restored
```

The workflow labels are not the main value. The value is turning every transition into analytical evidence:

- how long an incident waited
- where delay accumulated
- whether the delay is still actionable
- which asset and zone are affected
- how much rack, GPU, power, thermal, redundancy, and vendor exposure is attached to the incident
- whether the evidence is trustworthy
- what follow-up action is most useful now

## What It Analyzes

- Open infrastructure incidents and delayed incidents
- Current stage and hours in current stage
- Stage lead time compared with threshold hours
- Actionable bottlenecks, excluding terminal restored work from active follow-up surfaces
- Downtime concentration by infrastructure asset and facility zone
- Vendor/parts escalation, work-order blockers, and recovery blocker risk
- Capacity-at-risk, affected GPU, redundancy state, thermal-breach, vendor/parts, and mitigation context
- Impact confidence status that separates trusted, warning, and unverified impact context
- Repeat failure signals
- Facilities engineer assignment and validation delays
- Latest-run data quality and reconciliation issues
- Ranked downtime follow-up queue with recommended actions

## Architecture

```text
scattered AI infrastructure source records
  -> source-to-canonical RDF mappings
  -> named RDF graphs in Fuseki/TDB2
  -> OWL/RDFS ontology modules
  -> SHACL validation gates
  -> approved SPARQL read models
  -> Kotlin/JVM semantic-service
  -> React dashboard
```

The RDF graph store is the source of truth. The Kotlin/JVM semantic-service is the controlled API facade over approved query IDs, typed result envelopes, provenance, and semantic error contracts.

## Source Integration Model

The simulated sources represent the systems an operator normally has to reconcile manually:

- incident system
- workflow event history
- facility work order system
- critical spare and inventory context
- vendor ETA context
- telemetry alerts and readings
- validation results
- impact snapshots

See `docs/01_architecture.md` for the source-to-question mapping and trust risks.

## Ontology-Native Runtime

- `ontology/modules/`: OWL/RDFS modules for core, infrastructure, topology, workflow, impact, evidence, provenance, AI interaction, and operations concepts
- `shapes/`: SHACL contracts for source, canonical, reasoning, and service-boundary graph validation
- `fixtures/` and `rdf-mapping/`: source-to-canonical RDF fixtures and mapping contracts
- `queries/manifest.ttl`: approved query catalog with read-only SPARQL files under `queries/`
- `reasoning/`: reasoning pipeline contracts and placeholder reasoning query/rule structure
- `semantic-service/`: Kotlin/JVM runtime that loads approved queries, talks to Fuseki/TDB2, shapes typed result envelopes, serializes success/error responses, and serves the private semantic query endpoint
- `frontend/`: React/Vite dashboard that reads the semantic-service private endpoint through `VITE_SEMANTIC_API_BASE_URL`

## Semantic-Service Responsibilities

- Load and statically validate semantic service contracts
- Connect to Fuseki/TDB2 through a read-only graph access boundary
- Load controlled RDF fixtures through validation/provenance gates
- Execute only approved read-only SPARQL query IDs from the manifest
- Shape graph bindings into typed Kotlin result envelopes
- Serialize all endpoint responses through the semantic response serializer
- Reject raw SPARQL, unapproved query IDs, graph writes, public exposure, and non-loopback endpoint binding
- Provide graph-backed read models for dashboard overview, follow-up queue, filters, selected detail, impact, topology, trust findings, validation summary, incident evidence, dependency impact, and blast radius

## Production Story

The practical production path is intentionally modest:

- Dockerized Fuseki/TDB2 graph store
- Kotlin/JVM semantic-service runtime
- React frontend build target
- controlled RDF fixture/source loading through validation gates
- approved SPARQL read-model execution
- provenance-aware semantic response envelopes
- SHACL and query contract checks
- deployment and rollback notes

Kubernetes, Airflow, Kafka, and OpenTelemetry can be added later if they solve a specific operational need. They are deployment and integration choices, not the story. The story is faster, more trusted return-to-service follow-up.

Run semantic-service checks:

```bash
docker run --rm \
  -v "$PWD":/workspace \
  -w /workspace/semantic-service \
  gradle:8.10.2-jdk17 \
  gradle --no-daemon test
```

Run Fuseki locally:

```bash
docker compose up fuseki
```

Run the private semantic endpoint after Fuseki has fixture graphs loaded:

```bash
docker run --rm \
  -v "$PWD":/workspace \
  -w /workspace/semantic-service \
  -e DCAI_FUSEKI_DATASET_URL=http://host.docker.internal:3030/infrastructure \
  gradle:8.10.2-jdk17 \
  gradle --no-daemon run --args="--repo-root=/workspace --serve-private-query-endpoint"
```

## Semantic API Surface

Current private endpoint:

```text
POST /semantic/query/{queryId}
```

Approved product read-model query IDs include:

- `semanticFollowUpQueueList`
- `semanticDashboardOverview`
- `semanticFilterMetadata`
- `semanticFollowUpDetail`
- `semanticImpactSummary`
- `semanticTopologyDependencies`
- `semanticTrustFindingList`
- `semanticStageBottlenecks`
- `semanticAssetDelaySummary`
- `semanticZoneDelaySummary`
- `semanticSpareWaitSummary`
- `semanticValidationSummary`
- `semanticIncidentEvidence`
- `semanticIncidentTimeline`
- `semanticDependencyImpactByAsset`
- `semanticBlastRadiusByAsset`

The endpoint is internal/loopback only. It accepts approved query IDs, not raw SPARQL text.

## Semantic Workbench

The React frontend is built as a semantic operations workbench:

- Read-only graph finding summaries for restore readiness, trust review,
  redundancy exposure, dependency roles, capacity risk, and affected GPUs
- Semantic finding scope controls aligned with live graph vocabulary such as
  restore blocked, trust review, redundancy lost, vendor/parts escalation,
  recovery, and validation
- A compact findings table with incident, asset, zone, blocker, time, and
  detail links backed by approved semantic query IDs
- Dedicated finding detail route with a Summary explanation canvas plus Impact,
  Trust, and Dependencies tabs
- Detail evidence for stage history, work order context, impact snapshot
  context, telemetry evidence, vendor/mitigation status, impact trust flags,
  graph-derived dependency paths, SHACL validation status, semantic incident
  evidence, provenance chain, and SPARQL-backed blast-radius context
- Internal ontology action layer for governed operator actions such as restore
  blocker acknowledgement, evidence review assignment, validation review,
  reasoning finding approval/rejection, reasoning refresh request, and promotion
  batch approval. The current executable slice supports internal audit-only
  requests for restore blocker acknowledgement, evidence review assignment, and
  validation review; it does not expose public write endpoints or mutate
  canonical/reasoning/operations graphs.
- Controlled action affordances in selected finding Summary and Trust views.
  These are backed by the approved `semanticAvailableActionsByFinding` read
  model and show action labels, target ontology objects, required parameters,
  preconditions, provenance requirements, and disabled reasons. Supported
  audit-only actions can be submitted through the private loopback endpoint as
  managed action-audit graph requests.
- Action notifications and action-audit history in the selected finding action
  panel, backed by approved semantic query IDs for managed action-audit graph
  releases, incident targets, and target object URIs. They show pending local
  notifications, action status, actor, action type, validation result,
  provenance links, idempotency key, and graph lifecycle context without
  external system writeback.
- Internal ontology action lifecycle review in the selected finding action
  panel. Queued local actions can move through controlled `QUEUED`,
  `IN_REVIEW`, `APPROVED`, `REJECTED`, and `CLOSED` states through the private
  loopback transition endpoint. Transition history is read back through
  approved semantic query IDs and remains confined to the managed action-audit
  graph; it does not mutate canonical, reasoning, operations, production, or
  external source-system state.
- Simulated operations dispatch visibility for approved local ontology actions.
  When a local action reaches `APPROVED`, the managed action-audit graph records
  internal `NOC_QUEUE`, `WORK_ORDER_QUEUE`, and `VALIDATION_REVIEW_QUEUE`
  dispatch facts with provenance. These are displayed in the selected finding
  action panel and are not external notifications or source-system writeback.
- Read-only internal lifecycle review queues on the dashboard, backed by
  `semanticPromotionReviewQueue` and `semanticReasoningReviewQueue`. They show
  promotion batch, reasoning refresh, and reasoning approval state from managed
  graph facts while keeping all actions disabled.
- Dynamic ontology playback in the selected finding Summary view, backed by
  managed action-audit playback facts and approved query IDs for event
  timeline, graph state changes, reasoning/trust changes, and action lifecycle
  changes. It shows how source-system exports promote into canonical graph
  facts, reasoning deltas, blast-radius changes, and local action state over
  deterministic replay steps without exposing raw SPARQL or public writes.
- AI governance proposal review in the selected finding action panel.
  Controlled local AI proposal fixtures are validated with provenance, SHACL,
  confidence, risk, and model/prompt metadata gates, then written only to
  managed ai-audit graphs. Pending proposals can be approved or rejected through
  the private internal review endpoint. Rejections write only ai-audit review
  facts; approved action recommendations create governed local action-audit
  requests and still do not mutate canonical, reasoning, operations,
  production, or external source-system state.
