# Semantic Service Boundary

This directory contains the Kotlin/JVM semantic service transition runtime and
its boundary contracts. It started as non-runtime scaffolding in Phases 8-12;
post-Phase-20 it now includes an internal-only private semantic query endpoint
for the existing approved fixture inspection queries.

Phase 8 defines the semantic service as a controlled facade over the
Fuseki/TDB2 RDF dataset. The service may later expose use cases for query
execution, reasoning validation, provenance lookup, promotion review, and AI
governance handoff, but the RDF named graphs remain the source of truth.

Tracked contract:

- `semantic-service/boundary-contract.ttl`
- `semantic-service/openapi.semantic-service.yaml`
- `semantic-service/api-dtos.md`
- `semantic-service/src/main/resources/contracts/semantic-service-contracts.ttl`

Phase 9 adds OpenAPI-style endpoint shape and DTO documentation. It remains
non-runtime scaffold only: no service implementation, route handlers, DTO
classes, clients, or code generation are added.

Phase 10 adds minimal Gradle/Kotlin project metadata and package-layout
placeholders. It remains non-running scaffold only: no framework plugin,
application entry point, Kotlin source files, graph clients, controllers, DTO
classes, executable tests, or service runtime are added.

Phase 11 adds the first implementation slice: Kotlin contract loading and
static validation for the Phase 8-10 contract artifacts. It still does not add
HTTP endpoints, controllers, runtime DTO classes, graph execution, Fuseki/TDB2
clients, reasoning orchestration, or service runtime.

Phase 12 adds the cutover and implementation-readiness checkpoint. It recorded
the old FastAPI/Postgres/SQLAlchemy runtime as reference-only at that point and
defined the gates that had to pass before real semantic service endpoints or
graph execution could begin.

Tracked readiness checkpoint:

- `semantic-service/cutover-readiness.ttl`
- `docs/ontology-native/phase12_cutover_implementation_readiness.md`

Phase 13 adds the first runnable JVM baseline. The service can start as a
command-line contract-validation runtime, validate the Phase 8-12 contract
artifacts, print readiness state, and exit non-zero if validation fails. It
still does not expose HTTP endpoints, connect to Fuseki/TDB2, execute SPARQL,
write graphs, or orchestrate reasoning.

Run with local Java and Gradle:

```bash
cd semantic-service
gradle test
gradle run --args="$(pwd)/.."
```

Run with Docker if local Java or Gradle is unavailable:

```bash
docker run --rm \
  -v "$PWD":/workspace \
  -w /workspace/semantic-service \
  gradle:8.10.2-jdk17 \
  gradle --no-daemon test run --args=/workspace
```

Phase 14 adds a read-only Fuseki/TDB2 graph access boundary. It introduces
Apache Jena dependencies, read-only graph configuration, and a connectivity
client that can check the Fuseki query endpoint without exposing public HTTP
routes, writing RDF graphs, executing approved application queries, or running
reasoning.

Run the service baseline with a read-only graph connectivity check:

```bash
cd semantic-service
DCAI_FUSEKI_DATASET_URL=http://localhost:3030/infrastructure \
  gradle run --args="--repo-root=$(pwd)/.. --check-graph"
```

Docker equivalent:

```bash
docker run --rm \
  -v "$PWD":/workspace \
  -w /workspace/semantic-service \
  -e DCAI_FUSEKI_DATASET_URL=http://host.docker.internal:3030/infrastructure \
  gradle:8.10.2-jdk17 \
  gradle --no-daemon run --args="--repo-root=/workspace --check-graph"
```

Phase 15 adds controlled RDF fixture loading into Fuseki named graphs. The
runtime still has no public endpoints and does not run reasoning. Fixture
loading is only available through the local CLI boundary, validates the fixture
with SHACL and provenance gates, and then writes the controlled source and
canonical fixture named graphs.

Run the baseline without writes:

```bash
docker run --rm \
  -v "$PWD":/workspace \
  -w /workspace/semantic-service \
  gradle:8.10.2-jdk17 \
  gradle --no-daemon test run --args=/workspace
```

Run controlled fixture loading against a local Fuseki graph-store endpoint:

```bash
docker run --rm \
  -v "$PWD":/workspace \
  -w /workspace/semantic-service \
  -e DCAI_FUSEKI_DATASET_URL=http://host.docker.internal:3030/infrastructure \
  gradle:8.10.2-jdk17 \
  gradle --no-daemon run --args="--repo-root=/workspace --load-fixtures"
```

Phase 16 adds controlled read-only query execution. Queries must be listed in
`queries/manifest.ttl` with `implementationStatus "phase16-approved"` and must
parse as SELECT or ASK. Placeholder reasoning queries and update queries are not
executable in this phase.

Run an approved read-only query against fixture-loaded named graphs:

```bash
docker run --rm \
  -v "$PWD":/workspace \
  -w /workspace/semantic-service \
  -e DCAI_FUSEKI_DATASET_URL=http://host.docker.internal:3030/infrastructure \
  gradle:8.10.2-jdk17 \
  gradle --no-daemon run --args="--repo-root=/workspace --run-query=fixtureNamedGraphInventory"
```

Phase 17 adds stable result-envelope shaping for future semantic service
responses. The runtime remains CLI-only, but approved query results now map
into typed contracts for named graph inventory, incident summary, and
provenance source-record inspection.

Phase 18 adds a semantic response contract checkpoint. The runtime remains
CLI-only, but `openapi.semantic-service.yaml` and `api-dtos.md` now define
future typed query response shapes, semantic error envelopes, and versioning
rules aligned to the Phase 17 result envelopes.

Phase 19 adds internal-only response serialization. The runtime remains
CLI-only, but query-result envelopes and semantic errors can now be converted
into deterministic in-memory payload maps aligned to the Phase 18 contract.

Phase 20 adds the endpoint readiness decision checkpoint. The runtime remains
CLI-only; private endpoint scaffolding is deferred to a later approved phase
and any future endpoint must use the Phase 19 serializer instead of raw SPARQL
bindings.

Post-Phase-20 adds the first private endpoint slice:

- internal `POST /semantic/query/{queryId}`
- loopback-only bind host, defaulting to `127.0.0.1`
- approved query IDs only:
  - `fixtureNamedGraphInventory`
  - `fixtureIncidentSummary`
  - `fixtureProvenanceSourceRecords`
  - `semanticFollowUpQueueList`
  - `semanticDashboardOverview`
  - `semanticFilterMetadata`
  - `semanticFollowUpDetail`
  - `semanticImpactSummary`
  - `semanticTopologyDependencies`
  - `semanticTrustFindingList`
  - `semanticStageBottlenecks`
  - `semanticAssetDelaySummary`
  - `semanticZoneDelaySummary`
  - `semanticSpareWaitSummary`
  - `semanticValidationSummary`
  - `semanticIncidentEvidence`
  - `semanticIncidentTimeline`
  - `semanticDependencyImpactByAsset`
  - `semanticBlastRadiusByAsset`
- all success payloads go through `SemanticResponseSerializer`
- all errors use the Phase 18 semantic error envelope
- approved lookup queries accept string-valued `parameters`
- raw SPARQL request bodies, arbitrary query IDs, graph writes, reasoning
  execution, and public exposure remain blocked

Production graph ingestion and canonical promotion v1 adds the first executable
source-to-canonical lifecycle outside controlled fixture loading:

- source extract DTOs for facility, zone, asset, incident, dependency,
  workflow event, evidence, and impact records
- RDF mapping into separate source, canonical, and provenance models
- SHACL and provenance validation over the combined promotion candidate graph
- managed graph URI policy for `urn:dcai:graph:source:*`,
  `urn:dcai:graph:canonical:*`, and `urn:dcai:graph:provenance:*`
- rollback snapshots for target graphs before multi-graph promotion writes
- release manifest metadata returned by successful promotion orchestration

This v1 lifecycle is service-internal implementation code and focused tests. It
does not add public endpoints, authentication, reasoning refreshes, AI
governance workflows, frontend read-model changes, or live production connector
jobs.

Executable reasoning v1 adds internal dependency-exposure, recovery-blocker,
restore-readiness, impact-trust, and blast-radius reasoning over promoted
canonical graphs:

- reads managed canonical and provenance named graphs through `NamedGraphStore`
- generates candidate `dcai:DependencyImpactFinding` and
  `dcai:BlastRadiusFinding` facts plus `dcai:ReasoningActivity` provenance
- derives `dcai:RecoveryBlocker` facts from blocked,
  delayed, awaiting, missing, conflicting, or manual-review workflow,
  work-order, validation, and telemetry states in the canonical graph
- derives `dcai:RestoreReadinessFinding` facts from recovery blockers,
  work-order state, validation state, mitigation state, telemetry state,
  evidence confidence, stale evidence, unsupported impacts, and downstream
  dependency exposure
- derives `dcai:TrustFinding` facts for low-confidence evidence, conflicting
  validation, telemetry gaps, stale evidence, unsupported impact claims,
  unsupported evidence targets, and missing source payload-hash provenance
- validates reasoning output with SHACL and explicit provenance gates
- writes managed `urn:dcai:graph:reasoning-audit:*` and
  `urn:dcai:graph:reasoning:*` graphs with rollback snapshots

This reasoning slice is internal implementation code and tests. It does not add
public endpoints, authentication, AI governance workflows, frontend read-model
changes, or raw SPARQL exposure.

Internal graph lifecycle CLI commands add local controlled execution for the
v1 ingestion and reasoning lifecycles:

```bash
docker run --rm \
  -v "$PWD":/workspace \
  -w /workspace/semantic-service \
  -e DCAI_FUSEKI_DATASET_URL=http://host.docker.internal:3030/infrastructure \
  gradle:8.10.2-jdk17 \
  gradle --no-daemon run --args="--repo-root=/workspace --promote-source --source-release-id=local-controlled-source-v1"
```

```bash
docker run --rm \
  -v "$PWD":/workspace \
  -w /workspace/semantic-service \
  -e DCAI_FUSEKI_DATASET_URL=http://host.docker.internal:3030/infrastructure \
  gradle:8.10.2-jdk17 \
  gradle --no-daemon run --args="--repo-root=/workspace --refresh-reasoning --reasoning-input-release-id=local-controlled-source-v1 --reasoning-run-id=local-controlled-reasoning-v1"
```

The commands bind no HTTP routes. They run through the existing local runtime
entrypoint, managed graph URI policy, SHACL/provenance gates, and rollback
snapshots. `--promote-source` uses the built-in local controlled source extract;
`--refresh-reasoning` reads a managed canonical/provenance release and writes
managed reasoning-audit/reasoning graphs.

File-backed local ingestion and graph lifecycle inspection v1 extends the same
internal CLI boundary:

```bash
docker run --rm \
  -v "$PWD":/workspace \
  -w /workspace/semantic-service \
  -e DCAI_FUSEKI_DATASET_URL=http://host.docker.internal:3030/infrastructure \
  gradle:8.10.2-jdk17 \
  gradle --no-daemon run --args="--repo-root=/workspace --promote-source --source-release-id=local-controlled-source-v1 --source-extract-file=fixtures/source-extracts/local-controlled-source-v1.properties"
```

```bash
docker run --rm \
  -v "$PWD":/workspace \
  -w /workspace/semantic-service \
  -e DCAI_FUSEKI_DATASET_URL=http://host.docker.internal:3030/infrastructure \
  gradle:8.10.2-jdk17 \
  gradle --no-daemon run --args="--repo-root=/workspace --inspect-graph-lifecycle --inspect-release-id=local-controlled-source-v1 --inspect-reasoning-run-id=local-controlled-reasoning-v1"
```

The file-backed source extract format is a deterministic local `.properties`
fixture under `fixtures/source-extracts/`. Lifecycle inspection is read-only and
reports graph existence, canonical counts, provenance counts, and reasoning
finding counts for managed graph URIs. It does not add production connectors,
public endpoints, authentication, UI changes, or AI governance workflows.

Recorded source-system connector simulation v1 adds a local connector-shaped
input option to the same internal CLI boundary:

```bash
docker run --rm \
  -v "$PWD":/workspace \
  -w /workspace/semantic-service \
  -e DCAI_FUSEKI_DATASET_URL=http://host.docker.internal:3030/infrastructure \
  gradle:8.10.2-jdk17 \
  gradle --no-daemon run --args="--repo-root=/workspace --promote-source --source-release-id=recorded-local-ops-v1 --source-extract-directory=fixtures/source-extracts/recorded-source-systems/local-ops-v1"
```

The recorded connector loader reads local incident/workflow, asset/topology,
work-order/validation, and telemetry/impact CSV exports, maps accepted rows into
the existing `SourceExtractBatch` DTOs, quarantines invalid or duplicate rows in
a connector load report, and then uses the normal managed graph promotion path.
It does not add public endpoints, authentication, UI changes, AI governance, or
real external connector jobs.

Seeded recorded source-system scenario generation v1 adds deterministic local
export generation for the same recorded connector format:

```bash
docker run --rm \
  -v "$PWD":/workspace \
  -w /workspace/semantic-service \
  gradle:8.10.2-jdk17 \
  gradle --no-daemon run --args="--repo-root=/workspace --generate-source-scenarios --generated-source-profile=demo --generated-source-seed=20260610"
```

The supported profiles are `demo`, `mvp`, and `stress`. The stress profile
generates 600 scenarios and 10,000+ source rows for deterministic loader and
lifecycle stress checks. Generated exports can be promoted by combining
`--generate-source-scenarios` with `--promote-source` and a matching
`--source-release-id`, or by passing the generated directory through
`--source-extract-directory` in a later command. The generator remains internal,
local, deterministic, and connector-shaped; it does not add real external
connectors.

AI data center operations ontology hardening v1 strengthens the active
ontology-native path with explicit hall/zone/row/rack/GPU pod topology, UPS/PDU
and cooling/telemetry asset concepts, typed controlled vocabulary resources for
operational state, stricter SHACL where current promoted data supports it, and
competency tests for affected asset, upstream dependencies, evidence state,
recovery blocker, blast radius, and source-record lineage. This remains a
local deterministic simulation and internal runtime hardening slice; it does
not expose new endpoints, add auth, redesign UI, or connect to real external
systems.

Internal ontology action audit runner v1 adds audit-only execution for the
first controlled operator action contracts:

- `AcknowledgeRestoreBlocker`
- `AssignEvidenceReview`
- `RecordValidationReview`

The runner accepts controlled local `.properties` action request fixtures under
`fixtures/action-requests/`, validates required parameters and preconditions
against managed canonical/provenance/reasoning graph facts, maps accepted
requests into RDF `dcai:OntologyActionRequest`,
`dcai:OntologyActionExecution`, `dcai:OntologyActionNotification`, and
`dcai:ActionValidationReport` records, validates the action-audit graph with
SHACL/provenance gates, and writes only to managed
`urn:dcai:graph:action-audit:*` graph URIs. Idempotency keys prevent
deterministic reruns from duplicating action executions and notifications, and
failed writes restore the previous action-audit graph snapshot.

Submit a controlled local action audit after source promotion and reasoning
refresh:

```bash
docker run --rm \
  -v "$PWD":/workspace \
  -w /workspace/semantic-service \
  -e DCAI_FUSEKI_DATASET_URL=http://host.docker.internal:3030/infrastructure \
  gradle:8.10.2-jdk17 \
  gradle --no-daemon run --args="--repo-root=/workspace --submit-ontology-action --action-request-file=fixtures/action-requests/acknowledge-restore-blocker.properties --action-input-release-id=local-controlled-source-v1 --action-reasoning-run-id=local-controlled-reasoning-v1 --action-audit-release-id=local-action-audit-v1"
```

Inspect action audit history:

```bash
docker run --rm \
  -v "$PWD":/workspace \
  -w /workspace/semantic-service \
  -e DCAI_FUSEKI_DATASET_URL=http://host.docker.internal:3030/infrastructure \
  gradle:8.10.2-jdk17 \
  gradle --no-daemon run --args="--repo-root=/workspace --inspect-action-audit --inspect-action-audit-release-id=local-action-audit-v1"
```

The private loopback endpoint also accepts controlled UI action requests at
`POST /semantic/internal/action-request`. The endpoint accepts fixed string DTO
fields only, rejects raw SPARQL/query payloads, derives graph URIs from
controlled release/run IDs, validates action preconditions against managed
canonical/provenance/reasoning graph facts, and writes only audited request,
execution, notification, validation-report, and initial lifecycle transition
facts to the managed action-audit graph.

Internal ontology action state machine v1 extends that endpoint boundary with
`POST /semantic/internal/action-transition`. The transition endpoint accepts a
target action execution URI, controlled actor/idempotency identifiers, a
transition reason, and a target state. It permits only the controlled local
state flow `REQUESTED -> VALIDATED -> QUEUED -> IN_REVIEW ->
APPROVED|REJECTED -> CLOSED`, validates the candidate action-audit graph with
SHACL/provenance gates, updates notification state, and restores the previous
action-audit graph snapshot on write failure. Approved read models
`semanticActionReviewQueueByIncident` and
`semanticActionTransitionHistoryByIncident` expose the current review queue and
transition history to the React detail UI.

Internal ontology action dispatch simulation v1 extends approved local action
transitions with managed notification facts. When an action transition reaches
`APPROVED`, the service creates simulated `NOC_QUEUE`, `WORK_ORDER_QUEUE`, and
`VALIDATION_REVIEW_QUEUE` dispatch records in the managed action-audit graph,
validates them with the existing action-audit SHACL/provenance gate, and
exposes them through `semanticActionDispatchQueueByIncident`. These records are
for local review and UI visibility only; no external NOC, work-order,
validation, operations, production, or source-system writeback is attempted.

Dynamic ontology playback v1 adds a controlled local replay command for the
dynamic layer. The replay uses deterministic source-system scenario steps,
promotes each step through the existing source-to-canonical graph promotion
service, refreshes reasoning for each promoted step, then writes playback
event facts into the managed `urn:dcai:graph:action-audit:*` graph with a
dedicated SHACL/provenance gate and rollback on write failure. The playback
facts are exposed only through approved private read models:
`semanticDynamicEventTimelineByIncident`,
`semanticDynamicStateChangesByIncident`,
`semanticDynamicReasoningChangesByIncident`, and
`semanticDynamicActionLifecycleByIncident`.

Run controlled local dynamic playback against a local Fuseki graph-store:

```bash
docker run --rm \
  -v "$PWD":/workspace \
  -w /workspace/semantic-service \
  -e DCAI_FUSEKI_DATASET_URL=http://host.docker.internal:3030/infrastructure \
  gradle:8.10.2-jdk17 \
  gradle --no-daemon run --args="--repo-root=/workspace --run-dynamic-playback"
```

This is internal CLI/runtime functionality only. It does not expose public
endpoints, add authentication, mutate canonical/reasoning/operations graphs
from operator actions, perform source-system writeback, or implement AI
governance.

Internal AI governance proposal v1 adds an audit-only proposal layer for
AI-generated semantic suggestions. Controlled local `.properties` proposal
fixtures under `fixtures/ai-proposals/` can create `AIProposalBatch`,
`AIProposal`, and `AIProposalValidationReport` facts for reasoning finding
suggestions, action recommendations, and evidence summaries. The proposal
service validates source-record provenance, supporting evidence, target object
existence, confidence score, risk level, model/prompt placeholders, generatedAt,
SHACL constraints, and explicit provenance before writing only to a managed
`urn:dcai:graph:ai-audit:*` graph. Idempotency keys prevent deterministic
reruns from duplicating proposals, and failed writes restore the previous
ai-audit graph snapshot.

Submit a controlled local AI proposal after source promotion and reasoning
refresh:

```bash
docker run --rm \
  -v "$PWD":/workspace \
  -w /workspace/semantic-service \
  -e DCAI_FUSEKI_DATASET_URL=http://host.docker.internal:3030/infrastructure \
  gradle:8.10.2-jdk17 \
  gradle --no-daemon run --args="--repo-root=/workspace --submit-ai-proposal --ai-proposal-file=fixtures/ai-proposals/local-ai-governance-v1.properties --ai-input-release-id=local-controlled-source-v1 --ai-reasoning-run-id=local-controlled-reasoning-v1 --ai-audit-release-id=local-ai-governance-v1"
```

Approved read models `semanticAiProposalReviewQueue` and
`semanticAiProposalDetailByIncident` expose the audit queue and selected
incident detail to the private semantic query endpoint and React workbench.
Human review v1 adds private `POST /semantic/internal/ai-proposal-review` for
approve/reject decisions. Review decisions are written only to the managed
ai-audit graph. When an approved proposal is an `ACTION_RECOMMENDATION`, the
service creates a governed local ontology action request in the managed
action-audit graph through the existing action validation/provenance gates. If
that handoff fails, the AI review graph is restored to its previous snapshot.
This slice does not call external AI APIs, expose public endpoints, add
authentication, mutate canonical/reasoning/provenance/source/operations graphs
from AI proposals, or perform source-system writeback.

Post-Phase-20 semantic queue read-model implementation adds
`semanticFollowUpQueueList` as the first product read model. It returns
canonical graph incident, asset, zone, stage, and source-record provenance
fields.

The runtime cutover batches add additional private product read-model queries
for dashboard overview, filter metadata, follow-up detail, impact summary,
topology dependencies, trust findings, stage bottlenecks, asset/zone delay
summaries, spare/vendor wait summaries, validation summaries, incident
evidence, dependency impact, and blast radius. The React workbench now reads
these graph-backed semantic-service contracts through its API adapter.
Telemetry alerts, repeat-failure counters, engineer-assignment counters,
semantic data-quality detail lookup, and parameterized incident/asset lookup
are backed by RDF fixture facts, approved SPARQL bindings, typed envelopes,
result shaping, and serializer output.

Run the private endpoint against a fixture-loaded Fuseki dataset:

```bash
docker run --rm \
  -v "$PWD":/workspace \
  -w /workspace/semantic-service \
  -e DCAI_FUSEKI_DATASET_URL=http://host.docker.internal:3030/infrastructure \
  gradle:8.10.2-jdk17 \
  gradle --no-daemon run --args="--repo-root=/workspace --serve-private-query-endpoint"
```
